## Dataset
We select 1000 music tracks from the Million Song Dataset, and perform a one-week field study with 30 participants. During the field study, participants would listen to the recommended music, record their mood and preference ratings as feedback. Detailed explanations are shown in `data/README.md`.

## Implementation Codes
To run the codes, first run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Examples for running the codes are shown in `src/run.sh`. 

```
cd src/
bash run.sh
